# **RC-Escapade**
We made an RC car for the event, RC-Escapade, conducted by the Robotics Club of our institute, Techmaniacs, under the techno-cultural fest, Tirutsava of IIT Tirupati.

# Car's engineering aspect:
The major engineering constraint while making the car was the unavailability of professional RC race car components, a limited time of 15 days to design and construct the car and a limited budget of Rs.15000. Hence, every part of the car had to be indigenously and salvaging some parts.


This car used was throttled by a 55T Brushed Motor controlled by Original HobbyWing QuicRun 1060 60A Brushed Electronic Speed ​​Controller controlled by the user via a Flysky FS-GT2 Transmitter with FS-GR3E Receiver for Rc Car/Boat . The motor was connected to the axle using a (188mm long & 6mm width rubber )belt and pulley mechanism, which increased speed output due to a gear ratio of 3:4 . The car's steering used simple steering system in which we grab the outer part of ball bearing and join tire with inner part of ball bearing so the tire is free to move and we can change direction of grabbing element made by us ,we grab it by M-Seal and use servo to change direction with rod attached . The body of the car was divided into three sections, the Middle section contain Orange 4200mah 2S 35C/70C (7.4V) Lithium Polymer Battery and esc with motor on top but on back side which connect belt to pulley which connect to rod and rod connect to inner part of ball bearing and middle part is placed on outer part of ball bearing ,and last is front part our steering mechanism is there .
